## The Marketplace for Earning Power
NodeStore is where infrastructure meets liquidity. Buy, sell, and unlock value from node licenses, validator slots, and staking rights — all fully on-chain. This is where your liquidity begins. With NodeStore, you can treat participation like a position, flexible, tradable, and composable.
<Note>
This is where infrastructure meets liquidity. With NodeStore, you can buy, sell, and trade node licenses and participation rights, all permissionless. No lock-ins. No middlemen. No barriers.
