## Overview

KIP is a decentralized protocol that connects AI asset creators—like models, apps, and datasets—through on-chain data and payment infrastructure, supported by a network of validators, indexers, and other contributors. The ecosystem runs on the $KIP token, which powers transactions, governance, and network participation.
