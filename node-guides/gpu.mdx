## FAQ
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is GPU.net doing?">
    GPUnet aims to transform decentralized computing by providing scalable access to high-performance GPU resources for diverse computational needs, such as data analysis, AI development, and scientific research. Its core vision is to democratize access to these resources, making them easily available for all.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What are GPU Validator Nodes?">
    A **GAN Chain Validator Node** is a decentralized **GPU-powered computing node** that helps **verify transactions and secure the GAN Chain network**. Validators **stake GPoints**, run specialized **queen nodes for job assignments**, and are overseen by a **king node** that ensures system integrity. To become a validator, users must generate an SS58 address, and stake at least 100 GPoints.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How to setup and run Validator Nodes?">
    To run a GPU Validator Node, you must:
    
    - Have a Genesis Node NFT
    - Login to Easeflow
    - Choose the months for your subscription
    - Connect Wallet that contains the NFT
    - Generate Burner wallet (SS58) and don't forget to save the seed phrase
    - Top up burner balance 101 GPoints minimum
    - Stake the GPoints
    - Delegate by confirming and signing in wallet
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="On what chain is the project running?">
    GAN Chain
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How to earn rewards?">
    **Reward generation depends on several factors, including:**
    
    - **Node Participation:** Running your node consistently throughout the day boosts your rewards
    - **Number of NFTs Held:** The more NFTs you have, the higher your rewards
    - **Growing Network:** As more nodes and agents join the network daily, the reward pool is split among all participants, leading to lower individual rewards over time. Those with the highest participation and most NFTs mapped will see the greatest benefits
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I claim rewards?">
    Rewards claims are done automatically for the node operators.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How is the vesting schedule structured?">
    - **Investor Rounds (10% of total supply - 20M tokens)**
      - No cliff period
      - Tokens vest evenly over **12 months**
    - **Emissions Schedule for GAN Chain (90% of total supply - 180M tokens)**
      - **Proof of Stake (Validators & Queens):** 40% (80M tokens)
      - **Proof of Work (Compute & King subnets):** 40% (80M tokens)
      - **$GPU Native Liquidity:** 10% (20M tokens), released over multiple years
    - **Circulating Supply Growth via Doubling & Halving:**
      - **Initial emissions double** until **50% of total supply is reached**, then **halving starts**
      - **Additional Token Releases:** 3M GPU as an airdrop for Genesis Node holders after TGE
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Where can I monitor my node?">
    The [Node Portal](https://dashboard.gpu.net/) allows you to:
    
    - View active nodes
    - Monitor uptime performance
    - Monitor rewards
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Are the NFTs for the Validator nodes transferable? If yes, after how long?">
    Yes, after mainnet.
  </Accordion>
