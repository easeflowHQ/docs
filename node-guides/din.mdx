  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How to earn rewards?">
    **Reward generation depends on several factors, including:**
    
    - **Node Participation**: Running your node consistently throughout the day boosts your rewards.
    - **Number of NFTs Held**: The more NFTs you have, the higher your rewards.
    - **Growing Network**: As more nodes and agents join the network daily, the reward pool is split among all participants, leading to lower individual rewards over time. Those with the highest participation and most NFTs mapped will see the greatest benefits.

    1. Go to the **[node page](https://node.din.lol/)** and connect your wallet.
