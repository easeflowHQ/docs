<Accordion title="How much can I earn by running an Aethir node?">
  Earnings from an Aethir node depend on several factors:
  - **GPU Performance**: Higher-end GPUs (H100, A100, RTX 4090) earn more
  - **Uptime**: Consistent 24/7 operation maximizes earnings
  - **Network Demand**: Higher demand for GPU compute increases rewards
  - **Location**: Geographic location affects latency and task allocation
  
  Typical earnings range from $5-50+ per day depending on your setup and market conditions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens if my node goes offline?">
  If your Aethir node goes offline:
  - **Temporary outages**: Short disconnections (few minutes) usually don't affect earnings significantly
  - **Extended downtime**: Longer outages may impact your node's reputation score
  - **Automatic restart**: The node software typically auto-restarts after system reboots
  - **No penalties**: There are no direct financial penalties for downtime
  
  ```bash
  # Check node status
  ./aethir-node status
  
  # Restart the node service
  ./aethir-node restart
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I monitor my node's performance and earnings?">
  You can monitor your Aethir node through:
  - **Aethir Dashboard**: Web-based interface showing real-time stats
  - **Local Logs**: Check node logs for detailed information
  - **CLI Commands**: Use command-line tools for quick status checks
  - **Mobile App**: Aethir mobile app for on-the-go monitoring
  
  Key metrics to watch:
  - GPU utilization percentage
  - Tasks completed per hour
  - Network latency
  - Daily/weekly earnings
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I run multiple Aethir nodes on the same machine?">
  Yes, you can run multiple Aethir nodes if you have:
  - **Multiple GPUs**: Each node typically requires its own GPU
  - **Sufficient Resources**: Adequate RAM, CPU, and bandwidth
  - **Proper Configuration**: Different ports and directories for each node
  
  ```bash
  # Example for running multiple nodes
  ./aethir-node --gpu=0 --port=8080 --data-dir=./node1
  ./aethir-node --gpu=1 --port=8081 --data-dir=./node2
  ```
