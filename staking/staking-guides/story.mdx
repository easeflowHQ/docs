## Overview

Story Network is a purpose-built Layer 1 blockchain that seamlessly integrates the best of both the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and Cosmos SDK. It offers full EVM compatibility while incorporating deep execution layer optimizations to efficiently support graph-based data structures.

## FAQ
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What are Story Validator Nodes?">
    A validator in the Story Network is a full node that participates in the consensus mechanism, proposing new blocks and validating transactions. To participate in staking rewards, a validator must stake at least 1024 IP tokens and run a validator node. Validators are identified by a unique public key and can self-delegate IP tokens while earning rewards for their participation. They can become jailed for downtime or misbehavior but can also unstake tokens or redelegate them.

  <Accordion title="What is Story Protocol?">
    Story Network is a purpose-built Layer 1 blockchain that seamlessly integrates the best of both the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and Cosmos SDK. It offers full EVM compatibility while incorporating deep execution layer optimizations to efficiently support graph-based data structures. These optimizations make it particularly well-suited for handling complex intellectual property (IP) data structures in a cost-effective and scalable manner.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Locked vs Unlocked Tokens?">
    Unlocked tokens have no restrictions imposed on them and can be used for gas consumption, transfers, and staking.
    
    Unlike unlocked tokens, locked tokens cannot be transferred or traded and are unlocked based on an unlock schedule. However, locked tokens may be staked to earn staking rewards, with the locked staking reward rate being half of that of unlocked tokens.
    
    Staked locked and unlocked tokens have the same voting power. That means that a validator with 100 staked locked tokens has the same network voting power as a validator with 100 staked unlocked tokens.
    
    Both types of tokens can be slashed if their validators get slashed.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How is the vesting schedule structured?">
    - A fixed number of tokens are allocated for emissions in the first year.
    - Subsequent years use an emissions algorithm with adjustable parameters.
    - Annual emission rate: 20,000,000 tokens
    - Blocks per year: 10,368,000
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How to earn rewards?">
    **Reward generation depends on several factors, including:**
    
    - **Node Participation: Running your node consistently throughout the day boosts your rewards.**
    - **Number of Nodes Held: The more Nodes you have, the higher your rewards.**
    - **Growing Network: As more nodes and agents join the network daily, the reward pool is split among all participants, leading to lower individual rewards over time. Those with the highest participation and most Nodes mapped will see the greatest benefits.**
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How to setup and run Story Validator Nodes?">
    To run a Validator Node, you must:
    
    - Login to Easeflow
    - Choose the months for your subscription
    - Connect Wallet and click Generate
    - Switch chain to Odyssey testnet
    - Confirm and sign in the wallet.
    - Click Create Validator and make sure you have 1024 $IP to stake
    - Set commission rates, confirm the wallet, and click create
