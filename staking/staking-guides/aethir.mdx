  <Accordion title="How to earn rewards?">
    **Reward generation depends on several factors, including:**
    
    - **Node Participation**: Running your node consistently throughout the day boosts your rewards.
    - **Number of NFTs Held**: The more NFTs you have, the higher your rewards.
    - **Growing Network**: As more nodes and agents join the network daily, the reward pool is split among all participants, leading to lower individual rewards over time. Those with the highest participation and most NFTs mapped will see the greatest benefits.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I claim rewards?">
    $vATH tokens vest into $ATH in 120 days after you choose to claim. If an Owner choose to withdraw early (30 days) and skips the vesting period, a 75% penalty is applied to the conversion, and owner loses eligibility for bonus rewards. After 120 days, the default vesting period will be 180 days. There is a 10 $ATH minimum requirement for withdraw. (Require KYC)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How is the vesting schedule structured?">

  </Accordion>
