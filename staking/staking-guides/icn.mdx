## Overview

The Impossible Cloud Network (ICN) is a decentralized cloud infrastructure that connects enterprise-grade hardware and service providers into a scalable, secure network. It leverages Service-Level Agreement (SLA) oracles to monitor and enforce performance standards, ensuring reliable, transparent, and high-quality cloud services through decentralized technology.
