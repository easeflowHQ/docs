## Nodes & Licenses
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is a node?">
    A node is a virtual server that runs blockchain software, validates transactions, and earns rewards. It's the engine behind the network.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What is a license?">
    A license (an NFT) gives you the right to participate and provide compute to the network. Think of it as your "entry ticket".
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do I need a License to run a node?">
    You can run any node on easeflow without a license, to configure the node and participate in the network some projects require a delegation from a license or a number of tokens to be staked.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I get a license?">
    Node Licenses are typically sold by launchapds, or blockchain projects through their own node sale platform.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can one node support multiple licenses?">
    Yes, **in most projects** nodes can hold multiple licenses, depending on the network rules and node capacity.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I transfer licenses to another wallet?">
    It depends on the project. Some licenses may be transferable, others may have time locks or restrictions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens if my node expires?">
    Expired nodes are automatically deleted. To continue participation, you'll need to deploy a new one.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does nodes subscriptions auto-renew?">
    No, but you can always renew or extend the node subscription for longer duration.
  </Accordion>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I deploy a node?">
    Check out our Step-by-Step Deployment Guide. It only takes a few clicks.
  </Accordion>

    Nope. easeflow is fully cloud-managed. No downloads, no hardware, no server setup.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Will my node keep running if I turn off my computer?">
    Yes. Your node runs in the cloud 24/7 — even if you're offline.

    Use the easeflow dashboard for real-time metrics, uptime monitoring, and issue alerts.

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<AccordionGroup>

    For crypto payments, allow 15–30 minutes for confirmation. If it takes longer, open a support ticket with your transaction details.
