## FAQ
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Rivalz?">
    Rivalz is a blockchain-based network that connects AI agents with decentralized resources like storage, compute power, and real-world assets. It operates on **Dymension** and **Arbitrum**, using a **World Abstraction Layer** for seamless AI integration. Its modular system includes decentralized storage, identity management, real-time data coordination, and a Web3 AI development platform.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What are Znodes Nodes?">
    **ZNodes** are a key component of the Rivalz ecosystem, designed to enhance the security and functionality of the network. They are essentially **validator nodes** that participate in securing and validating transactions on the Rivalz platform. By running a zNode, users can contribute to the network's security and decentralization while earning rewards in the form of **$RIZ tokens**.
