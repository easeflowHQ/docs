  <Accordion title="What are Guardian Nodes?">
    A **Guardian Node** in HYCHAIN monitors and verifies network operations to ensure accuracy and security. It validates state assertions, signs off on legitimate ones, and earns rewards in $TOPIA tokens when those assertions are confirmed as correct. To operate a Guardian Node, users must own a **Node Key NFT**, which grants them the authority to participate in the validation process.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How to setup and run Guardian Nodes?">
