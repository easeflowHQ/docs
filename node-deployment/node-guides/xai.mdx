## FAQ
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is XAI Games?">
    Xai Games is a blockchain-based gaming ecosystem that enables real economies and open trade within video games, allowing traditional gamers to own, trade, and monetize in-game assets without needing a crypto wallet. Built on Arbitrum technology by Offchain Labs, Xai operates as a decentralized network where anyone can run a node to earn rewards and participate in governance, while the XAI Foundation supports Web3 game developers through funding, marketing, and maintaining the integrity of the blockchain and its native token.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What are Sentry Nodes?">
    Sentry Nodes in the Xai network monitor the rollup protocol to detect and flag incorrect blocks, helping resolve the verifier's dilemma. They can be run on personal devices or cloud instances, but earning rewards requires purchasing a **Sentry Key** and keeping the node online with sufficient gas fees. These nodes participate in the **Attention Challenges v2 protocol**, verifying assertions and submitting correct successor state roots to earn esXAI rewards. Pool operators can run Sentry Nodes for multiple key holders, allowing passive rewards. To redeem esXAI for XAI, operators must pass KYC checks ensuring they are not in the USA or under OFAC sanctions.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How to setup and run Sentry Nodes?">
    To run a Sentry Node, you must:
    
    - Have a Sentry key NFT
    - Login to Easeflow
    - Choose the months for your subscription
    - Connect Wallet that contains the NFT
    - Delegate by confirming and signing in wallet
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="On what chain is the project running?">
    Arbitrum
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How to earn rewards?">
    **Reward generation depends on several factors, including:**
    
    - **Node Participation:** Running your node consistently throughout the day boosts your rewards
    - **Number of NFTs Held:** The more NFTs you have, the higher your rewards
    - **Growing Network:** As more nodes and agents join the network daily, the reward pool is split among all participants, leading to lower individual rewards over time. Those with the highest participation and most NFTs mapped will see the greatest benefits
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I claim rewards?">
    Rewards claims require KYC from Node operators. The purchase of Nodes does not require KYC, however we encourage users to be prepared for KYC to claim their rewards.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How is the vesting schedule structured?">
    The **XAI token vesting schedule** includes a **4-year lockup for seed investors (1-year cliff + 3-year linear release)**, a **3.5-year vesting for strategic investors (9-month cliff + 33-month linear)**, and a **4-year vesting for the team (1-year cliff + 3-year linear)**. The **ecosystem fund (40% of supply) unlocks over 5+ years**, while **community allocations (27%) have shorter or immediate vesting**.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Where can I monitor my node?">
    The [Node Portal](https://sentry.xai.games/) allows you to:
    
    - View active nodes
    - Monitor uptime performance
    - Monitor rewards
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Are the NFTs for the Sentry nodes transferable? If yes, after how long?">
    Yes
  </Accordion>
