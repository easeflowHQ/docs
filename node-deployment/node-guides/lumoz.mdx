## FAQ
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Lumoz?">
    Lumoz is a modular AI computing network providing high-performance computing and zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) services for AI and Rollup applications across multiple chains. It features Verifier Nodes for proof verification and Compute Nodes using PoW to generate ZK proofs. Lumoz reduces ZK computation costs and boosts efficiency, making zero-knowledge tech more accessible and scalable.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What are Verifier Nodes?">
    Verifier Nodes in Lumoz validate zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) generated by Compute Nodes, ensuring their correctness and maintaining system security. They perform distributed verification, requiring two-thirds consensus to confirm proof validity. Verified results are submitted on-chain via Lumoz's AVS Oracle, ensuring efficient, low-cost, and secure ZK and AI data processing.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How to setup and run Verifier Nodes?">
    To run a Verifier Node, you must:
    
    - Have a Genesis Node NFT
    - Login to Easeflow
    - Choose the months for your subscription
    - Connect Wallet that contains the NFT
    - Generate Burner Address by clicking on generate button
    - Delegate by confirming and signing in wallet
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="On what chain is the project running?">
    Lumoz Chain
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I claim rewards?">
    Rewards claims require KYC from Node operators. The purchase of Nodes does not require KYC, however we encourage users to be prepared for KYC to claim their rewards.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How is the vesting schedule structured?">
    25% of Total Allocation: **10B $MOZ**.
    
    25% of Lumoz tokens will be released over 3 years, with 95,129.37 esMOZ released per hour (one epoch).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Where can I monitor my node?">
    The [Node Portal](https://zkverifier.lumoz.org/my-node) allows you to:
    
    - View active nodes
    - Monitor uptime performance
    - Monitor rewards
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Are the NFTs for the Verifier nodes transferable? If yes, after how long?">
    Yes, nodes can be transferred 6 months after TGE.
  </Accordion>
