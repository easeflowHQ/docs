**How to earn rewards?**
Reward generation depends on several factors, including:
- **Node Participation**: Running your node consistently throughout the day boosts your rewards.
- **Number of NFTs Held**: The more NFTs you have, the higher your rewards.
- **Growing Network**: As more nodes and agents join the network daily, the reward pool is split among all participants, leading to lower individual rewards over time. Those with the highest participation and most NFTs mapped will see the greatest benefits.

**How do I claim rewards?**
$vATH tokens vest into $ATH in 120 days after you choose to claim. If an owner chooses to withdraw early (30 days) and skips the vesting period, a 75% penalty is applied to the conversion, and the owner loses eligibility for bonus rewards. After 120 days, the default vesting period will be 180 days. There is a 10 $ATH minimum requirement for withdrawal. (Requires KYC)

**How is the vesting schedule structured?**
| Category | Vesting |
| --- | --- |
| Team | 18 Months Cliff, 36 Months Linear Vest |
| Airdrop | Season 1: 25% at Listing Season 2: 25% at 8 Months Season 3: 50% at 16 Months |
| Ecosystem | Ecosystem Development: 50% at TGE, 24 Months Linear DAO Treasury: 48 Months Linear |
| Investors | 12 Months Cliff, 24 Months Linear Vest |
| Checker Nodes and Compute Providers | Checker Nodes: 4 Years Linear Based on Performance Guidelines Edge and Enterprise Compute: According to Reward Schedules |

**Where can I monitor my node?**

## Story

**What are Story Validator Nodes?**
A validator in the Story Network is a full node that participates in the consensus mechanism, proposing new blocks and validating transactions. To participate in staking rewards, a validator must stake at least 1024 IP tokens and run a validator node. Validators are identified by a unique public key and can self-delegate IP tokens while earning rewards for their participation. They can become jailed for downtime or misbehavior but can also unstake tokens or redelegate them.

**What is Story Protocol?**
Story Network is a purpose-built Layer 1 blockchain that seamlessly integrates the best of both the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and Cosmos SDK. It offers full EVM compatibility while incorporating deep execution layer optimizations to efficiently support graph-based data structures. These optimizations make it particularly well-suited for handling complex intellectual property (IP) data structures in a cost-effective and scalable manner.

**Locked vs Unlocked Tokens?**
Unlocked tokens have no restrictions imposed on them and can be used for gas consumption, transfers, and staking.

Unlike unlocked tokens, locked tokens cannot be transferred or traded and are unlocked based on an unlock schedule. However, locked tokens may be staked to earn staking rewards, with the locked staking reward rate being half of that of unlocked tokens.

Staked locked and unlocked tokens have the same voting power. That means that a validator with 100 staked locked tokens has the same network voting power as a validator with 100 staked unlocked tokens.

Both types of tokens can be slashed if their validators get slashed.

**How is the vesting schedule structured?**
- A fixed number of tokens are allocated for emissions in the first year.
- Subsequent years use an emissions algorithm with adjustable parameters.
- Annual emission rate: 20,000,000 tokens
- Blocks per year: 10,368,000

**How to earn rewards?**
Reward generation depends on several factors, including:
- **Node Participation: Running your node consistently throughout the day boosts your rewards.**
- **Number of Nodes Held: The more Nodes you have, the higher your rewards.**
- **Growing Network: As more nodes and agents join the network daily, the reward pool is split among all participants, leading to lower individual rewards over time. Those with the highest participation and most Nodes mapped will see the greatest benefits.**

**How to setup and run Story Validator Nodes?**
To run a Validator Node, you must:
- Login to Easeflow
- Choose the months for your subscription
- Connect Wallet and click Generate
